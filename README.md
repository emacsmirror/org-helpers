# org-helpers

`org-helpers` was a generalized implementation and slightly enhanced version of the GTD agenda skipping functions described by [Bernt Hansen](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html#Projects) that I found 4 years ago. It has served me well for a long time.

Recently I stumbled upon [org-query](https://github.com/remyhonig/org-query), which seems to be a much cleaner implementation for writing flexible org-mode agenda skipping functions. Check it out!
